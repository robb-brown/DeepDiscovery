# We create a list of dictionaries.  Every dictionary is an example, and should
# have at least the key 'input' equal to an image.  We also have 'truth' equal to
# our true image (the manual CC segmentation).  At this point
# we could manually specify which examples should be used for training and
# which should be reserved for testing or validation, but we can also let
# the DeepDiscovery data object do that for us.

# reserveForValidation 0.1 keeps 10% of the data in the validation group.  We could also
# give an integer value (like 1) that would reserve that many examples.
# We're training a segmenter, so we need our truth image converted into one-hot (one channel per class).
# We have two classes (not corpus callosum = 0 and corpus callosum = 1) so we set truthComponents to
# [0,1].  The first channel will be the positive mask.

# allocation, for consistency we might want to use this same object for training
# different networks.

# Our network downsamples a certain number of times, and the input image needs to be a
# multiple of 2**depth where depth is the number of downsampling steps.  For now, this
# is done by the data object.  This will be moved to the network preprocessing though.
